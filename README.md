# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue with Dynamically Generated Class Names

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS with dynamic class names, particularly in frameworks like Vue.js. The problem arises when dynamically generated class names contain slight misspellings or unexpected characters, causing Tailwind CSS to fail to apply the corresponding styles.

## Problem Description

When using the `v-bind` directive in Vue.js (or similar mechanisms in other frameworks) to dynamically apply Tailwind CSS classes, there's a risk of introducing typos or unexpected characters into the class names.  Tailwind CSS strictly relies on the precise class name structure to apply styles; therefore, any deviation can result in the absence of styling.

## Solution

The primary solution involves meticulous attention to detail when generating class names dynamically. Using helper functions or computed properties to ensure the accuracy of class names is highly recommended. Input validation and sanitization can further prevent this issue.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run serve` to start the development server.
4. Observe the styling inconsistencies in the `bug.vue` component. The `bugSolution.vue` component showcases the corrected implementation.
