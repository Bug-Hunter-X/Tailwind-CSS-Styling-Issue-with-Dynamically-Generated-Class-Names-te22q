The solution is to ensure the dynamically generated class names are perfectly accurate.  Here's an example using a computed property in Vue.js:

```vue
<template>
  <div :class="dynamicClasses"></div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    dynamicClasses() {
      return {
        'bg-blue-500': this.condition1,
        'text-white': this.condition1,
        'p-4': true,
        //Add more class based on conditions
      };
    }
  },
  data() {
    return {
      condition1: true,
    };
  }
};
</script>
```

This approach uses a computed property to cleanly generate class names based on conditions, reducing the chance of errors.  Always validate and sanitize user inputs before using them to build class names.
